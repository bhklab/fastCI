abstract = {ROC curves and summary measures of accuracy derived from them, such as the area under the ROC curve, have become the standard for describing and comparing the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Methods for estimating ROC curves rely on the existence of a gold standard which dichotomizes patients into disease present or absent. There are, however, many examples of diagnostic tests whose gold standards are not binary-scale, but rather continuous-scale. Unnatural dichotomization of these gold standards leads to bias and inconsistency in estimates of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric estimator of diagnostic test accuracy which does not require dichotomization of the gold standard. This estimator has an interpretation analogous to the area under the ROC curve. We propose a confidence interval for test accuracy and a statistical test for comparing accuracies of tests from paired designs. We compare the performance (i.e. CI coverage, type I error rate, power) of the proposed methods with several alternatives. An example is presented where the accuracies of two quick blood tests for measuring serum iron concentrations are estimated and compared.},

@article{Kang2015,
abstract = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is often used as a summary index of the diagnostic ability in evaluating biomarkers when the clinical outcome (truth) is binary. When the clinical outcome is right-censored survival time, the C index, motivated as an extension of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, has been proposed by Harrell as a measure of concordance between a predictive biomarker and the right-censored survival outcome. In this work, we investigate methods for statistical comparison of two diagnostic or predictive systems, of which they could either be two biomarkers or two fixed algorithms, in terms of their C indices. We adopt a U-statistics-based C estimator that is asymptotically normal and develop a nonparametric analytical approach to estimate the variance of the C estimator and the covariance of two C estimators. A z-score test is then constructed to compare the two C indices. We validate our one-shot nonparametric method via simulation studies in terms of the type I error rate and power. We also compare our one-shot method with resampling methods including the jackknife and the bootstrap. Simulation results show that the proposed one-shot method provides almost unbiased variance estimations and has satisfactory type I error control and power. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed method with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@incollection{Steck2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we show that classical survival analysis involving censored data can naturally be cast as a ranking problem. The concordance index (CI), which quantifies the quality of rankings, is the standard performance measure for model $\backslash$emph{\{}assessment{\}} in survival analysis. In contrast, the standard approach to $\backslash$emph{\{}learning{\}} the popular proportional hazard (PH) model is based on Cox's partial likelihood. In this paper we devise two bounds on CI--one of which emerges directly from the properties of PH models--and optimize them $\backslash$emph{\{}directly{\}}. Our experimental results suggest that both methods perform about equally well, with our new approach giving slightly better results than the Cox's method. We also explain why a method designed to maximize the Cox's partial likelihood also ends up (approximately) maximizing the CI.},

abstract = {We prove a conjecture of Haglund which can be seen as an extension of the equidistribution of the inversion number and the major index over permutations to ordered set partitions. Haglund's conjecture implicitly defines two statistics on ordered set partitions and states that they are equidistributed. The implied inversion statistic is equivalent to a statistic on ordered set partitions studied by Steingr{\'{i}}msson, Ishikawa, Kasraoui, and Zeng and is known to have a nice distribution in terms of q-Stirling numbers. The resulting major index exhibits a combinatorial relationship between q-Stirling numbers and the Euler-Mahonian distribution on the symmetric group, solving a problem posed by Steingr{\'{i}}msson.},

@article{Chan2010,
abstract = {We give an O(n $\backslash$sqrt{\{}$\backslash$log{\{}n{\}}{\}})-time algorithm for counting the number of inversions in a permutation on n elements. This improves a long-standing previous bound of O(n lg n/ lg lg n) that followed from Dietz's data structure [WADS'89], and answers a question of Andersson and Petersson [SODA'95]. As Dietz's result is known to be optimal for the related dynamic rank problem, our result demonstrates a significant improvement in the offline setting. Our new technique is quite simple: we perform a “vertical partitioning” of a trie (akin to van Emde Boas trees), and use ideas from external memory. However, the technique finds numerous applications: for example, we obtain • in d dimensions, an algorithm to answer n offline orthog- onal range counting queries in time O(n lgd−2+1/d n); • an improved construction time for online data structures for orthogonal range counting; • an improved update time for the partial sums problem; • faster Word RAM algorithms for finding the maximum depth in an arrangement of axis-aligned rectangles, and for the slope selection problem. As a bonus, we also give a simple (1 + $\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm for counting inversions that runs in linear time, improving the previous O(n lg lg n) bound by Andersson and Petersson.},
